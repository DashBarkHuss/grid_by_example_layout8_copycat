# grid_by_example_layout8_copycat
Looking at [Rachel Andrew's](https://github.com/rachelandrew) layout examples on [gridbyexample.com](https://gridbyexample.com/), I recreated [layout8](https://gridbyexample.com/examples/code/layout8.html) in order to practice grid.

See more of Rachel's example layouts here: [Examples](https://gridbyexample.com/examples/page-layout/)

See the git repo for her site here: [Git Repo](https://github.com/rachelandrew/grid-by-example)
