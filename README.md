# grid_by_example_layout8_copycat
Looking at [Rachel Andrew's](https://github.com/rachelandrew) layout examples on [gridbyexample.com](https://gridbyexample.com/), I recreated [layout8](https://gridbyexample.com/examples/code/layout8.html) in order to practice grid.

I'm including my steps for anyone who is intrested in my workflow. I perdonally like seeing exactly what people are doing when they practice coding.

**My Steps**
1. I copied the [layout8](https://gridbyexample.com/examples/code/layout8.html) page and images manually but it's probably available on the git repo linked below. 
2. Deleted the internal css except for lines 8-18 which set up the page to work well as a responsive layout. These lines are generally included in most responsive layout projects. Though, I am not familiar with the line that sets the font percentage, it looks like it's setting the font to be responsive too.
3. I kept the original page open on gridbyexample.com and made the browser window smaller than 460px wide to see what the smallest breakpoint looked like. I tried my best to copy the css without looking at the source code. Then I compared my code to the original up to the first breakpoint.
4. I made the original page window wider than 460 pixels. I attempted to copy the code up to this breakpoint in a new media query. I compared my code with the original code. I repeated this process for 660px;
5. I haven't done step five yet, but it would be to recreate the css from scratch without looking at the code in between each media query.
